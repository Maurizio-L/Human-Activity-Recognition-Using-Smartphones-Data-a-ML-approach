# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones-Data-a-ML-approach
Using some ML methods we are going to predict human activity. 30 people were used to perform 6 different activities. Each of them was wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII on their waist. Using the smartphone’s embedded sensors (the accelerometer and the gyroscope), the user’s speed and acceleration were measured in 3-axial directions. We use the sensor’s data to predict user’s activity. Human activity we will be classified (1-Walking, 2-Walking upstairs, 3-Walking downstairs, 4-Sitting, 5-Standing or 6-Laying) by using the smartphone’s sensors. Meaning that by using the following methods, the smartphone can detect what we are doing at the moment.
